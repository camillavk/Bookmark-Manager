Bookmark Manager

This week's project was to create a bookmark manager. The goal was to expose us to the following aspects of web development;
- Integration testing: Capybara
- Relational databases
- Security

The bookmark manager will be a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. The website will have the following options:
- Show a list of links from the database
- Add new links
- Add tags to the links
- Sign up as a user
- Sign in and out
- Send a welcome email to new users
- Send a password reset email to users who have forgotten their passwords. 

The completed site is uploaded onto heroku here:
